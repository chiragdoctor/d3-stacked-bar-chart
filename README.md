# d3-stacked-bar-chart
In this exercise we are using D3 to produce a stacked bar chart and analysing the count of "DE_ADDRESS" being hit by users. 

# Follow bellow steps to start the project 

1. git clone git@github.com:chiragdoctor/d3-stacked-bar-chart.git (if you are downloading from github)
2. Once the project is downloaded do ``` npm install ```
3. Once all the dependecies are installed run this script to spin up the project ``` npm run start ```. This will automatically load up the page on ``` http://localhost:3000 ``` and will run eslint in background.
